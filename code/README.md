# Sitecore Reports Module

This is the massively upgraded Sitecore Advanced System Reporter module, originally developed by Raul Jimenez [rauljmz] a very long time ago. This module was born circa 2008, way back when Sitecore was still on version 6. Holy crap, that's like a decade ago.

So why did I decide to resurrect this module from the dead?
Well it was never really dead, just lurking in the shadows. Over the years we had more than one client ask for a reporting solution and I gradually upgraded the module for each Sitecore version. I'm not sure why I never pushed the upgraded and improved version back to GitHub - lack of time I suppose.


## Note

The following Sitecore support patch for Sitecore CMS 8.2 rev. 161221 (Update-2) has been incorporated into the module.
The issue was directly affecting the ability to export and download reports.
