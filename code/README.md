# Sitecore Reports Module

This is the massively upgraded Sitecore Advanced System Reporter module, originally developed by Raul Jimenez [rauljmz] a very long time ago. This module was born circa 2008, way back when Sitecore was still on version 6. Holy crap, that's like a decade ago.

So why did I decide to resurrect this module from the dead?
Well it was never really dead, just lurking in the shadows. Over the years I had more than one client ask for a reporting solution and I gradually upgraded the module for each Sitecore version. I'm not sure why I never pushed the upgraded and improved version back to GitHub - lack of time I suppose. A few minor improvements were added to the module here and there, mostly to add more flexibility for scanning, filtering and viewing. The last major upgrade also focused on aligning the module with the Helix Framework principles to allow it to be used alongside other Helix based modules.


## Note

Use of TDS (Team Development for Sitecore) for item syncronisation has been replaced with Unicorn as it is available for free and does not require a paid license, which many developers didn't have access to.

The following Sitecore support patch for Sitecore CMS 8.2 rev. 161221 (Update-2) has been incorporated into the module.
The issue was directly affecting the ability to export and download reports.
