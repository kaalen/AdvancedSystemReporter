Advanced System Reporter
------------------------
v.1.5

- added support for the columns field in all viewers. When using a custom viewer you can override the AllowableColumns property to populate the dropdown in the column editor.

- Incorporated a Ribbon control

- fixed an issue where a desktop link would not be created correctly if the report was not first run once.

- fixed wrong cursor type over page change links

- fixed incompatibility with Brightcove module

- removed dependency on Domain Objects

- fixed refresh button (now only evaluates filters)

- added ability to use parameteres with a different syntax

- added option LanguageFallback to the LinkItemsScanner so it displays extra item properties

v.1.4.3

- fixed various issues with casing of properties in scanners and filters which threw exceptions

v.1.4.2

- removed Email Reports - ASR item, which was not used

- ItemViewer now displays dates according to the current culture and can be overriden with attribute DateFormat (using a standard .NET formatting string as the value).

v.1.4.1

- Fixed error in WorkflowStateScanner

- Fix the default sorting options for viewers. You can add sort=[name of column],[ASC|DESC][DateTime] to viewers (thanks to Marko Tsoi for this fix)

v 1.4

- Greatly improved performance

- New Trim Versions command added to the Multiple Versions report. Allows to remove all but x versions from the selected items. The number of versions to leave is configurable in the command definition (/sitecore/system/Modules/ASR/Configuration/Commands/TrimVersions)

- New Alias Viewer (as showcased in the Alias Report) that can display aliases configured for items.

- New: parameters to scanners, viewers, filters, are assigned directly by reflection, so developers simply create a property with getter and setter corresponding to the parameter. Casting to common types (string, int, DateTime) is done automatically.

- New: Commands can now also be defined as a standard type string (fully qualified name, assembly).

- New: Commands can have parameters. Simply add them in parenthesis after the command name, with the same format as a query string, and they will get assigned automatically to properties by reflection.

- Fixed: the standard ItemViewer would not show data from fields with the same name as the keywords used to retrieve item properties (name, version, language, etc.). You can now prepend @ to indicate that it should retrieve a field. (e.g. @name will try to show a field called 'name', whereas name will display the name of the item).

- Fixed: $sc_currentuser replacement now works properly.

- Fixed: Owned items, My Owned items, ignore case sensitivity in the user name (to avoid a known issue where items have as owner sitecore\admin even though the user is sitecore\Admin).

- Improved: Eliminated need for proxies.
